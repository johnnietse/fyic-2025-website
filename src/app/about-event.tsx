            A conference hosted by engineering students, for engineering students.
            <br />
            <br />
            Presented by the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (OSPE), FYIC gives first-year engineering students from across Ontario the opportunity to connect with peers from around the province and participate in sessions designed to develop leadership skills, break down first-year barriers, and advance their career exploration. Attended by over 130 first-year and upper-year students from 18 universities across Ontario, this conference serves to inspire students and build connections to last their whole careers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Hosted with the Engineering Student Societies' Council of Ontario (ESSCO), FYIC 2025 will take place at Queen's University, a world-renowned institution and a leader in engineering research and innovation.
            <br />
            <br />
            The First Year Integration Conference (FYIC) is a unique, province-wide initiative that brings together first-year engineering students from 18 universities across Ontario. Our goal is to ease the transition into university life by providing a welcoming and inspiring space where students can build connections, develop leadership skills, and gain valuable insight into the world of engineering.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through a dynamic lineup of interactive workshops, seminars, and dedicated industry networking events, FYIC empowers students to explore their academic and professional potential. By connecting with peers and industry professionals alike, participants begin their engineering journey with confidence, curiosity, and community.
            <br />
            <br />
            This year, our theme is 'A Present for the Future'. We aim to inspire the next generation of bright minds to design sustainable solutions that will benefit generations to come. With additional emphasis on personal development, delegates will learn skills that will help them grow into the engineers they want to be.
